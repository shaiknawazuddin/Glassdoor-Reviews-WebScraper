# Glassdoor-Reviews-WebScraper

This is a very first version of my first ever webscraper I built using my webscraping skills.

## To use this scraper you'll need libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, time & Pandas

Pandas and time will already be present in any version of anaconda but to install BeautifulSoup and requests, type the following scripts in your command prompt:

1) conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4
2) conda install -c anaconda-forge requests

Please change the header's user-agent to your perosnal user-agent. Just type "My user agent" on google and paste the value to key 'User-Agent'.

Make sure you use the right format as mentioned in the code while providing the link.

This is a very basic and first version of the scraper, I will try to update and refine my code as I improve. But if there is any changes you feel are suitable to your needs, feel free to do so.

# Either way HAPPY SCRAPING :)
